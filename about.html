            <br>
            The idea for this board game cafe came straight from Canada, during a trip. We fell in love with this idea which combines the passion for the game and sharing a special experience. 
            <br>
            Our principle, in a hygge spirit, is to connect through play.

            « Lots of games available in English. We played Copenhagen (naturally) and Ludo (a Danish version of Sorry!) Snacks and beverages were good. Packed full of many groups playing board games. Pure loveliness! »

            « Brilliant concept in smaller edition. Like the intimacy of this place and great selection of games. Worth the 25 oer person if you plat games you usually do not have access to. »
